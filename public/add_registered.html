   <h1>Adding a contact which is already receiving notifications</h1>
   <p>If you are already receiving notifications at an email, text or phone, from NotifyMyClub.com you can associate those Groups with your NotifyMyClub.com login by explicitly joining the Group while you are logged into NotifyMyClub.com.</p>
<p>Type the Group name, from which you are already receiving notifications, into the "Join Existing Group" text box.</p>

<p>Doing this will cause NotifyMyClub to automatically connect that group with your login information, and the group will be listed under your groups in the left-hand portion of your default screen.</p>
